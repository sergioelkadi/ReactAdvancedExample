# ReactAdvancedExample
Welcome to this example that will hopefully serve as a template to new react projects
Here's the sequence I believe can work: 
1. Create a repository in gitHub
2. Create a README.md file, just like this one
3. Commit changes on the README
4. Open repository @ https://vscode.dev/?vscode-lang=pt-br
5. On terminal, initialize npm react nodes.
6. Add changes to repository
7. Commit changes
8. Pull changes
9.
